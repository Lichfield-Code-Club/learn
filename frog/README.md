# Step1
* This is the basis of a pygame.
* It draws a window, listens for the quit event and closes the window
* Note that the lines in the 'while' loop are repeated 60 times each second 

# Step2
* Adding a background image

# Step3
* Adding a frog image
* Please modify the code to draw the frog in the right place

# Step4
* Make the frog move

# Step5
* Make the frog stop at the right hand edge of the screen

# Step6
* Make the frog stop at the left hand edge of the screen

# Step7
* use keys to move the frog

# Step8
* At this point we know how to load an image and move it around
* We could repeat these steps for each car and each log in the game
* but that's not good programming practice.
* There an idiom called DRY which means Don't Repeat Yourself
* we now need to use arrays/lists

# Step9
* Make the cars and logs move

# Step10
* Make frog move while pressing keys

# Step11
* Add collision detection
